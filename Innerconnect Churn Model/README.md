Interconnect Churn Model

Overview

Interconnect, a telecom provider, faces a customer churn issue, where users progressively leave the service. Since retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, this project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn. The model evaluates historical contract data, demographics, and service usage to predict churn likelihood. The primary evaluation metric is the AUC-ROC score, with a target of at least 0.75 to ensure robust classification.

Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language for the project.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-Learn: Implementation of machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment.

Key Findings

Model Performance: The final Gradient Boosting model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.8625, exceeding the initial target.

Feature Importance: Key factors influencing churn include contract type, payment method, and tenure duration.

Predictive Accuracy: The model effectively distinguishes between churn and non-churn customers, validated by both AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics.

Data Preparation

The dataset includes four key sources:

Contract Data: Details on contract type, payment method, monthly charges, and tenure.

Personal Data: Customer demographics such as gender, age, and partner status.

Internet Data: Internet service details, including security, backup, and streaming options.

Phone Data: Multiple line subscriptions and phone service usage.

Data Processing Steps:

Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing entries with appropriate replacements (e.g., "No Service").

Feature Engineering: Created tenure-based insights and converted categorical features into numerical representations.

One-Hot Encoding: Encoded categorical variables for better model interpretability.

Scaling: Standardized numerical features such as monthly charges and total charges.

Model Development

Conclusion

The Gradient Boosting model was selected as the final model due to its strong predictive performance and ability to identify at-risk customers effectively.

Business Impact:

Targeted Customer Retention Strategies: Focus on customers with month-to-month contracts and high-risk payment methods.

Service Improvement: Address churn drivers by enhancing support and providing additional customer incentives.

Predictive Insights: Deploy the model in Interconnectâ€™s CRM system for proactive retention efforts.

Next Steps:

Integrate the model into a real-time churn monitoring system.

Further optimize hyperparameters for even better prediction accuracy.
