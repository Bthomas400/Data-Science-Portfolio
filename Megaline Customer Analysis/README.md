# Megaline Telecom Plan Revenue Analysis

## Overview
This project leverages statistical analysis to determine which of the two prepaid plans—Surf and Ultimate—offered by telecom operator Megaline, generates more revenue. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the company's commercial department optimize the advertising budget based on the profitability of each plan.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and aggregation.
- **NumPy** for numerical data operations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **SciPy** for performing statistical tests.
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment to document the analysis process.

## Key Findings
- The Surf plan generates higher total revenue compared to the Ultimate plan, primarily due to overage charges as users frequently exceed their plan limits.
- Statistical tests reveal significant differences in revenue generation between the two plans, confirming that the Surf plan is more profitable on a per-user basis.
- Detailed analysis of user behavior shows that despite the lower monthly charge, Surf plan users often incur higher total costs due to additional usage fees.

## Conclusions
The detailed comparative analysis of the Surf and Ultimate plans has shown that the lower base price of the Surf plan is offset by higher extra usage fees, making it more revenue-generating than the Ultimate plan. This suggests a potential area for Megaline to focus its marketing efforts to maximize profit.

## Future Work
- **Data Enrichment**: Incorporate additional demographic and usage data to refine customer segmentation and further personalize plan recommendations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a machine learning model to predict customer overage and churn based on usage patterns.
- **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Explore the implementation of a dynamic pricing model based on user behavior and preferences to optimize revenue.
